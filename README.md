# Huffman Coding Project

## Project Overview
This Huffman Coding Project is a Java implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm, which is used for efficient data compression. The project includes functionality to build a Huffman tree, generate Huffman codes, encode and decode messages, and perform a comparative analysis with the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) algorithm.

### Features
- Build Huffman trees using a dual-queue method.
- Generate Huffman codes for each character in the input message.
- Encode and decode messages using generated Huffman codes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Java installed on your machine. This project uses Java SE 11 or higher. You can check your Java version by running:
